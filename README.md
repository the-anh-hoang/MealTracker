# Diet tracker

## A app to manage all your nutrients

This application is created to allow user to input their favourite food along with the nutrients within them. When creating meals with the saved foods, the application will automatically calculate the total amount of calories and other macro-nutrients value and give it back to the user. The program is perfect for those who wants to track their calories and diets but don't have the time to search up their daily food every day and calculate it manually. 

As someone who likes to work out, this project is interesting for me because it actually solve my daily problems and I'm sure that it can solve many others too. 

**User story:**
- As a user, I want to be able to input in food and their nutrients value and add it into a list of foods
- As a user, I want to able to create meals based on the saved foods by viewing my list of saved foods and choose them.
- As a user, I want to calculate total calories of the meals I created
- As a user, I want the user to choose if they want to choose between creating their own meal or would like a random generated one
- As a user, I want to choose my goals (loosing weight, gaining muscle) and the program would evaluate my nutrients to see if they suit my goals.
