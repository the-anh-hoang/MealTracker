# Diet tracker

## A app to manage all your nutrients

This application is created to allow user to input their favourite food along with the nutrients within them. When creating meals with the saved foods, the application will automatically calculate the total amount of calories and other macro-nutrients value and give it back to the user. The program is perfect for those who wants to track their calories and diets but don't have the time to search up their daily food every day and calculate it manually. 

**A few functionality of the program would be:**
- Allow user to add food and their nutrients value and save them
- Create meals based on the saved foods and save them
- Calculate total calories with the selected meals
- Classify if a meal is healthy or not based on their nutrition values 

As someone who likes to work out, this project is interesting for me because it actually solve my daily problems and I'm sure that it can solve many others too.
